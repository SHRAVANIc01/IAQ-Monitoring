# IAQ-Monitoring

# ðŸŒ¿ IAQ Monitoring System (Flutter + Firebase + ThingSpeak)

This IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) Monitoring System tracks and displays real-time indoor air metrics like temperature, humidity, PM2.5, VOCs, and COâ‚‚ levels. It uses environmental sensors to collect data, uploads it to ThingSpeak, and fetches and visualizes it through a Flutter-based mobile application with Firebase integration for user management and optional data logging.

## ðŸ“± Features

- Real-time air quality display using ThingSpeak APIs
- Graphical sensor data visualization (charts)
- Firebase Authentication (Login/Signup)
- Firebase Firestore for optional data storage/logs
- Alert system for poor air quality
- Clean, responsive UI
